# 📋 Agent Development Plan

## ### What's Missing

#### 1. **MFE Architecture Implementation** 🏗️ **CURRENT FOCUS**
- [ ] Transform web-shell into Shell Host + Items MFE architecture
- [ ] Implement Webpack Module Federation for runtime composition
- [ ] Create shared libraries for common UI components
- [ ] Establish patterns for cross-MFE communication
- [ ] Document MFE development workflow

#### 2. **Extended MFE Ecosystem** 🔧s Repo Is

**Itty Bitty Context** is a forkable boilerplate repository designed to be maximally effective for AI-assisted development. This template provides a production-ready foundation with conventions that help AI agents understand, navigate, and modify code efficiently.

### Tech Stack
- **Nx Workspace** - Monorepo tooling for scalable development
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript, Swagger/OpenAPI docs
- **Frontend**: React + Vite with TypeScript
- **Shared**: Contracts library for type-safe API communication
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support

### Use Case
Fork this repo to quickly bootstrap new projects with AI agent-friendly conventions already in place. Every decision in this template asks: "Will this be clear and actionable for an AI assistant?"

## ✅ Current Status

### What's Working
- ✅ **Nx Workspace** - Properly configured with auto-sync
- ✅ **Web Shell** - React + Vite app with TypeScript (default Vite template)
- ✅ **API Core** - NestJS backend with Swagger setup and validation pipes
- ✅ **OpenAPI Documentation** - Live Swagger docs at `/api/docs` with full Items API spec
- ✅ **Contracts Library** - Shared types and DTOs for Items API
- ✅ **Items API** - Complete CRUD with proper Swagger documentation and error handling
- ✅ **Development Scripts** - Root package.json with convenience commands
- ✅ **TypeScript Configuration** - Path mapping for `@/contracts` configured and working
- ✅ **Testing Setup** - Jest tests passing for both API and contracts
- ✅ **Build System** - Both API and web apps build successfully
- ✅ **API Server** - Runs successfully with Swagger UI accessible

### What's Missing

#### 1. **Frontend Integration** � **NEXT UP**
- [ ] Replace default Vite app with actual items management UI
- [ ] Add API service layer using fetch or axios
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend Items API
- [ ] Create forms for Create/Update operations
- [ ] Display items list with Delete functionality

#### 2. **API Client Generation** 🔧
- [ ] Add second MFE for demonstration (Settings, Dashboard, etc.)
- [ ] Create shared UI component library across MFEs
- [ ] Implement state management patterns for MFE communication
- [ ] Add MFE-specific testing and e2e test strategies

#### 3. **API Client Generation** 🔧
- [ ] Add OpenAPI client generation for MFEs
- [ ] Create `npm run generate:client` script  
- [ ] Set up automated type sync between backend and frontend

#### 4. **Enhanced Development Workflow** 🔧
- [ ] Add database integration example (SQLite for simplicity)
- [ ] Create example e2e tests showing MFE integration
- [ ] Add comprehensive development environment setup documentation
- [ ] Create debugging tools for MFE runtime issues

#### 5. **Documentation & Examples** 🔧
- [ ] Add comprehensive MFE architecture documentation
- [ ] Create example business logic beyond basic CRUD
- [ ] Add example of real-world MFE communication patterns
- [ ] Document deployment strategies for MFE applications

#### 6. **Production Readiness** 🔧
- [ ] Add Docker setup for containerization
- [ ] Environment configuration management
- [ ] Build optimization and deployment scripts

## 🚀 Current Focus

**See `CURRENT_TASK_PLAN.md` for detailed implementation plan of current task.**

### Active Task: MFE Architecture Transition 🏗️
**Status**: Planning Complete  
**Goal**: Transform web-shell into 2-item Micro Frontend architecture (Shell + Items MFE)  
**Why**: Demonstrate scalable patterns for AI-assisted development with clear separation of concerns

### Next Major Milestones

#### 1. **MFE Foundation** (Current) 🏗️
- [ ] Create Shell Host application with Module Federation
- [ ] Extract Items functionality into dedicated MFE
- [ ] Establish runtime composition patterns

#### 2. **Enhanced MFE Ecosystem** 🔧
- [ ] Add second MFE (e.g., Settings, Dashboard)
- [ ] Create shared UI component library
- [ ] Implement cross-MFE communication patterns
- [ ] Add MFE-specific testing strategies

#### 3. **Production Patterns** 🚀
- [ ] Add authentication across MFEs
- [ ] Implement deployment strategies for independent MFEs
- [ ] Create monitoring and observability for MFE performance
- [ ] Add advanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
