# ðŸ“‹ Agent Development Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Repo Is

**Itty Bitty Context** is a forkable boilerplate repository designed to be maximally effective for AI-assisted development. This template provides a production-ready foundation with conventions that help AI agents understand, navigate, and modify code efficiently.

### Tech Stack
- **Nx Workspace** - Monorepo tooling for scalable development
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript, Swagger/OpenAPI docs
- **Frontend**: React + Vite with TypeScript
- **Shared**: Contracts library for type-safe API communication
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support

### Use Case
Fork this repo to quickly bootstrap new projects with AI agent-friendly conventions already in place. Every decision in this template asks: "Will this be clear and actionable for an AI assistant?"

## âœ… Current Status

### What's Working
- âœ… **Nx Workspace** - Properly configured with auto-sync
- âœ… **Web Shell** - React + Vite app with TypeScript (default Vite template)
- âœ… **API Core** - NestJS backend with Swagger setup and validation pipes
- âœ… **OpenAPI Documentation** - Live Swagger docs at `/api/docs` with full Items API spec
- âœ… **Contracts Library** - Shared types and DTOs for Items API
- âœ… **Items API** - Complete CRUD with proper Swagger documentation and error handling
- âœ… **Development Scripts** - Root package.json with convenience commands
- âœ… **TypeScript Configuration** - Path mapping for `@/contracts` configured and working
- âœ… **Testing Setup** - Jest tests passing for both API and contracts
- âœ… **Build System** - Both API and web apps build successfully
- âœ… **API Server** - Runs successfully with Swagger UI accessible

### What's Missing

#### 1. **Frontend Integration** ï¿½ **NEXT UP**
- [ ] Replace default Vite app with actual items management UI
- [ ] Add API service layer using fetch or axios
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend Items API
- [ ] Create forms for Create/Update operations
- [ ] Display items list with Delete functionality

#### 2. **API Client Generation** ðŸ”§
- [ ] Add OpenAPI client generation for frontend
- [ ] Create `npm run generate:client` script
- [ ] Set up automated type sync between backend and frontend

#### 3. **Enhanced Development Workflow** ðŸ”§
- [ ] Add database integration example (SQLite for simplicity)
- [ ] Create example e2e tests showing API usage
- [ ] Add development environment setup documentation

#### 4. **Documentation & Examples** ðŸ”§
- [ ] Add comprehensive README with quick start guide
- [ ] Create example business logic (beyond basic CRUD)
- [ ] Add example of real-world API patterns

#### 5. **Production Readiness** ðŸ”§
- [ ] Add Docker setup for containerization
- [ ] Environment configuration management
- [ ] Build optimization and deployment scripts
