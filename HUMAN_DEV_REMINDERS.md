# üß† Human Dev Reminders

**For humans who forget commands (which is all of us).**

This file collects all the common commands and workflows for the Itty Bitty Context boilerplate. Because remembering every CLI flag is impossible.

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Use the root package.json scripts** - they're set up for convenience
- **Check `nx.json` and `package.json`** if commands aren't working
- **Swagger docs are your friend** - always up-to-date API reference
- **Path mapping is configured** - use `@/contracts` imports
- **Tests should pass before commits** - CI will catch you if they don't

## üìÅ Working in Subfolders

When opening just a project subfolder in VS Code (to keep context itty bitty!):

- **Look for the 4 context files** - auto-generated context about the monorepo:
  - `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - What this project is and why you're here
  - `MONOREPO_CONTEXT.md` - How this fits in the bigger picture  
  - `COMMANDS.md` - What you can run and how
  - `DEPENDENCIES.md` - What this connects to
- **Run `npm run generate:context`** from root to update these files
- **Links back to root docs** are included in each project context
- **Files are auto-generated** but committed to help AI agents

**Pro tip**: AI agents especially benefit from these context files when working in subfolders - they explain the constraints and "why you can't just install things"!

**Remember**: When in doubt, check the tool's `--help` flag or the official docs!
