# 🎯 Current Task Plan: MFE Architecture Transition

## � Project Context

**Itty Bitty Context** is a forkable boilerplate repository designed to be maximally effective for AI-assisted development. This Nx workspace demonstrates production-ready patterns with conventions that help AI agents understand, navigate, and modify code efficiently.

**Current Tech Stack:**
- **Nx Workspace** - Monorepo tooling with pnpm
- **Backend**: NestJS + TypeScript + Swagger/OpenAPI (port 3000)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript (port 4200) 
- **Shared**: Contracts library for type-safe API communication
- **Current Status**: Complete Items CRUD API with working frontend

**Key Principle**: Every decision asks "Will this be clear and actionable for an AI assistant?"

## �📋 Task Overview

**Objective**: Transform the current monolithic web-shell into a 2-item Micro Frontend (MFE) architecture that demonstrates scalable patterns for AI-assisted development.

**Current State**: Single React app (`web-shell`) that manages Items with a complete CRUD interface connected to the NestJS API.

**Target State**: Host application with 2 independent micro frontends:
1. **Shell App** - Navigation, routing, shared layouts, and MFE orchestration
2. **Items MFE** - Complete Items management functionality (extracted from current web-shell)

## 🎯 Why This Architecture?

### Benefits for AI-Assisted Development
- **Isolated Concerns**: Each MFE can be developed, tested, and reasoned about independently
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined interfaces between components make AI context more manageable
- **Incremental Development**: Add new features as separate MFEs without touching existing code
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different MFEs can use different frameworks/versions
- **Team Scalability**: Multiple AI agents could work on different MFEs simultaneously

### Technical Benefits
- **Independent Deployments**: Each MFE can be deployed separately
- **Runtime Composition**: Dynamic loading and unloading of features
- **Fault Isolation**: One MFE failure doesn't bring down the entire application
- **Code Reusability**: MFEs can be shared across different shell applications

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### High-Level Structure
```
apps/
├── shell-host/           # Main shell application (new)
│   ├── Module Federation host
│   ├── Navigation & routing
│   ├── Shared layout components
│   └── MFE orchestration
├── items-mfe/           # Items micro frontend (new)
│   ├── Complete Items CRUD functionality
│   ├── Module Federation remote
│   └── Extracted from current web-shell
└── web-shell/           # Current app (will be deprecated)
    └── Keep temporarily for reference
```

### Module Federation Strategy
- **Shell Host**: Webpack Module Federation host that loads remote MFEs
- **Items MFE**: Webpack Module Federation remote that exposes Items functionality
- **Shared Dependencies**: React, React-DOM shared between shell and MFEs
- **Independent Builds**: Each MFE builds and deploys independently

### Shared Libraries

## 📝 Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Session 1)
**Goal**: Create the basic MFE infrastructure without breaking existing functionality

#### 1.1 Create Shell Host Application
- [ ] Generate new Nx app: `shell-host`
- [ ] Configure Webpack Module Federation as host
- [ ] Set up basic routing with React Router
- [ ] Create minimal layout with navigation placeholder
- [ ] Configure to load Items MFE at runtime

#### 1.2 Create Items MFE Application  
- [ ] Generate new Nx app: `items-mfe`
- [ ] Configure Webpack Module Federation as remote
- [ ] Copy Items functionality from web-shell:
  - [ ] ItemForm component
  - [ ] API service layer
  - [ ] Items management logic
- [ ] Expose Items module through Module Federation

#### 1.3 Configure Module Federation
- [ ] Install `@nx/webpack` and Module Federation plugins
- [ ] Configure webpack configs for host/remote setup
- [ ] Set up shared dependencies (React, React-DOM)
- [ ] Test that Items MFE loads in Shell Host

### Phase 2: Feature Migration (Session 2)
**Goal**: Move all Items functionality to the MFE and verify full functionality

#### 2.1 Complete Items MFE Implementation
- [ ] Move all Items-related components from web-shell
- [ ] Copy and adapt API service layer
- [ ] Implement Items routing within the MFE
- [ ] Add error boundaries specific to Items functionality
- [ ] Test Items CRUD operations in isolation

#### 2.2 Shell Host Integration
- [ ] Implement navigation to Items section
- [ ] Set up routing to load Items MFE
- [ ] Add loading states for MFE initialization
- [ ] Implement error handling for MFE failures
- [ ] Test full integration flow

#### 2.3 Shared Libraries Creation
- [ ] Extract common UI components to `shared-ui`
- [ ] Create MFE utilities in `mfe-utils`
- [ ] Update both apps to use shared libraries
- [ ] Verify builds and runtime functionality

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (Session 3)
**Goal**: Polish the MFE setup for production use and documentation

#### 3.1 Build & Development Optimization
- [ ] Configure Nx build targets for all apps
- [ ] Set up development mode with hot reloading
- [ ] Optimize shared dependencies and bundle sizes
- [ ] Add build validation and testing

#### 3.2 Documentation & Developer Experience
- [ ] Update README with MFE architecture explanation
- [ ] Create MFE development guidelines
- [ ] Add troubleshooting documentation
- [ ] Update agent development rules for MFE patterns

#### 3.3 Testing & Validation
- [ ] Add integration tests for MFE loading
- [ ] Test Items functionality in both development and build modes
- [ ] Validate error scenarios and fallbacks
- [ ] Performance testing for MFE loading

## 🎯 End State Definition

### Success Criteria
1. **Shell Host** runs on port 4200 with navigation
2. **Items MFE** loads dynamically at runtime
3. **Full Items CRUD** functionality works identically to current web-shell
4. **Independent Development** - Items MFE can be developed/built separately
5. **Clean Separation** - No shared state between shell and MFE beyond contracts
6. **Documentation** - Clear instructions for adding new MFEs

### File Structure After Completion

```

### Runtime Behavior
1. User navigates to `http://localhost:4200`
2. Shell Host loads with navigation menu
3. User clicks "Items" in navigation
4. Shell dynamically loads Items MFE from `http://localhost:4201`
5. Items functionality works identically to current implementation
6. User can navigate back to shell or to future MFEs

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start shell host
npm run dev:shell

# Start items MFE (in parallel)
npm run dev:items

# Or start everything
npm run dev:mfe
```

## 🚧 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Module Federation Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity incrementally
- **Build Configuration**: Use Nx generators for consistent setup
- **Runtime Errors**: Implement robust error boundaries and fallbacks
- **Performance**: Monitor bundle sizes and loading times

### Development Risks
- **Feature Regression**: Keep original web-shell until MFE is fully validated
- **Context Switching**: Complete one MFE fully before starting another
- **Documentation Debt**: Document decisions and patterns as we implement

## 🔄 Validation Points

### After Phase 1
- [ ] Shell Host loads successfully
- [ ] Items MFE can be accessed independently
- [ ] Basic integration works (can see Items UI in Shell)

### After Phase 2  
- [ ] All Items CRUD operations work in MFE
- [ ] Navigation between shell and Items is seamless
- [ ] Error handling works correctly

### After Phase 3
- [ ] Build process is documented and reliable
- [ ] New developers can add MFEs following patterns
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for development use

**Next Action**: Begin Phase 1.1 - Create Shell Host Application with Nx generator and basic Module Federation setup.
